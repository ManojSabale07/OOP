    "Q1] What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
    "Ans :Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) -:\n",
    "        Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects, which are instances of classes.\n",
    "        OOP enables the modeling of real-world entities by combining data (attributes) and behavior (methods) into objects. \n",
    "        Key features of OOP include encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2] What is a class in OOP?\n",
    "Ans :Class -:\n",
    "        A class in OOP is a blueprint or template for creating objects. \n",
    "        It defines the attributes (data) and methods (functions) that the objects of the class will have. \n",
    "        Classes encapsulate data and behavior in a single unit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3] What is an object in OOP?\n",
    "Ans Object -:\n",
    "        An object in OOP is an instance of a class. \n",
    "        It is a concrete entity that encapsulates data (attributes) and behavior (methods) as defined by its class. \n",
    "        Objects represent real-world entities and interact with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4] What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
    "Ans :Abstraction and Encapsulation are key concepts in OOP but differ in focus\n",
    "     1. Abstraction -:\n",
    "        Focuses on hiding complexity by exposing only essential features.\n",
    "        Achieved using abstract classes and interfaces.\n",
    "     2. Encapsulation:\n",
    "        Focuses on restricting access to internal data by bundling it with methods.\n",
    "        Achieved using access modifiers (e.g., `private`, `protected`, `public`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5] What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
    "Ans :Dunder -:\n",
    "        Dunder methods (short for Double UNDERscore methods) are special methods in Python surrounded by double underscores, like __init__ or __str__.          They enable custom behavior for built-in operations such as:\n",
    "            Initialization: __init__ (object constructor)\n",
    "            String representation: __str__ (human-readable object description)\n",
    "            Operator overloading: __add__, __sub__\n",
    "            Length and iteration: __len__, __iter__\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6] Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP?\n",
    "Ans :Inheritance -:\n",
    "        Inheritance in OOP allows a class (child class) to derive properties and behaviors from another class (parent class). \n",
    "        It promotes code reuse and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes.\n",
    "        Parent Class (Superclass): The base class that provides attributes and methods.\n",
    "        Child Class (Subclass): The derived class that inherits or overrides features of the parent class.\n",
    "        Types:\n",
    "            Single Inheritance: One child inherits from one parent.\n",
    "            Multiple Inheritance: A child inherits from multiple parents.\n",
    "            Multilevel Inheritance: A child inherits from another child class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7] What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
    "Ans :Polymorphism -:\n",
    "        Polymorphism in OOP allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common parent class. \n",
    "        It enables a single interface to represent different underlying forms (data types or methods).\n",
    "        Key Types -:\n",
    "            Method Overriding: Subclass provides a specific implementation of a method defined in its superclass.\n",
    "            Method Overloading: Same method name with different parameter lists (not directly supported in Python but can be mimicked).\n",
    "            Operator Overloading: Using operators like +, -, etc., with custom behavior for user-defined classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8] How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
    "Ans :Encapsulation -:\n",
    "        Encapsulation in Python is achieved by restricting access to an object's internal data and methods. \n",
    "        It allows controlled access using public, protected, and private attributes.\n",
    "        Key Concepts:\n",
    "            Public Attributes:\n",
    "                1] Accessible from anywhere.\n",
    "                2] Example: self.attribute\n",
    "            Protected Attributes:\n",
    "                1] Indicated by a single underscore (_attribute).\n",
    "                2] Accessible within the class and its subclasses (not strictly enforced).\n",
    "            Private Attributes:\n",
    "                1] Indicated by double underscores (__attribute).\n",
    "                2] Not directly accessible outside the class (name mangling used).\n",
    "\n",
    "Q9] What is a constructor in Python?\n",
    "Ans :Constructor -:\n",
    "        A constructor in Python is a special method named __init__ that is automatically called when an object of a class is created. \n",
    "        It is used to initialize the attributes of the object.\n",
    "        Key Features:\n",
    "            1] Automatic Invocation: Called automatically during object creation.\n",
    "            2] Initialization: Used to set up initial values for attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q10] What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
    "Ans :Class Methods:\n",
    "        Class methods operate on the class rather than the instance. \n",
    "        They are defined using the @classmethod decorator and take cls as their first parameter, which refers to the class itself.\n",
    "        Key Points:\n",
    "            1] Can modify class-level attributes.\n",
    "            2] Do not depend on any instance of the class.\n",
    "     Static Methods:\n",
    "        Static methods do not depend on the instance or the class. \n",
    "        They are defined using the @staticmethod decorator and do not take self or cls as the first parameter.\n",
    "        Key Points:\n",
    "            1] Behave like regular functions but are defined within the class.\n",
    "            2] Cannot modify class or instance state."

    "Q11] What is method overloading in Python?\n",
    "Ans :Overloading -:\n",
    "        Method overloading in Python refers to defining a method that can perform different tasks based on the number or type of arguments passed.              While Python does not support method overloading natively, it can be implemented by using default arguments or by handling arguments                    dynamically.\n",
    "        Key Points:\n",
    "            1] Python allows a single method to handle multiple use cases using dynamic arguments.\n",
    "            2] The last defined method with the same name overwrites previous ones in a class.\n"

    "Q12] What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
    "Ans :Overriding -:\n",
    "        Method overriding in OOP occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its parent class. \n",
    "        The subclass's method overrides the parent's method, enabling polymorphism.\n",
    "     Key Features:\n",
    "        The method in the subclass must have the same name, parameters, and signature as in the parent class.\n",
    "        Allows the subclass to customize or extend the behavior of the parent class's method.\n",
    "        Achieves runtime polymorphism.\n",

    "Q13] What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
    "Ans :Property decorator -:\n",
    "        The @property decorator in Python is used to define a method as a property, allowing it to be accessed like an attribute while still providing          method-like functionality. \n",
    "        It helps implement getter, setter, and deleter methods in a clean, Pythonic way.\n",
    "        Key Features:\n",
    "            Simplifies access to class attributes.\n",
    "            Encapsulates attribute logic while keeping syntax clean.\n",
    "            Ensures control over attribute access and modification.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q14] Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
    "Ans :Polymorphism -:\n",
    "        It is important in OOP because it allows for flexibility, scalability, and code reusability by enabling the same interface or method to behave          differently across various classes.\n",
    "        Key Reasons:\n",
    "            Code Reusability:\n",
    "                Enables writing generic code that works with multiple types or classes, reducing duplication.\n",
    "            Extensibility:\n",
    "                Makes it easy to add new behaviors or classes without altering existing code.\n",
    "            Dynamic Behavior:\n",
    "                Enables runtime decision-making, where the correct method is called based on the object's type.\n",
    "            Supports Abstraction:\n",
    "                Hides implementation details while allowing consistent behavior across derived classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q15] What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
    "Ans :Abstract class -:\n",
    "        An abstract class in Python is a class that cannot be instantiated directly and is used as a blueprint for other classes. \n",
    "        It contains one or more abstract methods, which must be implemented by its subclasses. Abstract classes are defined using the ABC \n",
    "        (Abstract Base Class) module.\n",
    "        Key Features:\n",
    "            Abstract Methods: Defined with the @abstractmethod decorator; these methods have no implementation in the abstract class.\n",
    "            Concrete Methods: Abstract classes can also include fully implemented methods.\n",
    "            Inheritance: Subclasses must implement all abstract methods to be instantiable.\n",
    "        Purpose:\n",

    "Q23] How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
    "Ans :Polymorphism in Python allows you to use a single interface or method to operate on objects of different types. With inheritance, polymorphism          enables you to define methods in a base class and override them in derived classes to achieve different behaviors while maintaining the same            method signature.\n",
    "     Here’s how polymorphism works in Python with inheritance:\n",
    "        Method Overriding:\n",
    "            In Python, polymorphism is often achieved through method overriding, where a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that               is already defined in its parent class.\n",
    "            Even though the method name remains the same, the behavior can vary across different subclasses.\n",
    "        Dynamic Dispatch:\n",
    "        Python uses dynamic dispatch (also known as late binding) to decide which method to call based on the object’s type at runtime.\n",
    "        When you call a method on an object, Python will look for the method in the object's class and move up the inheritance chain if the method is           not found in the current class."

    "Q24] What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
    "Ans :Method chaining -: \n",
    "        Method chaining in Python OOP refers to the technique of calling multiple methods on the same object in a single statement.\n",
    "        This is possible because each method in the chain returns the object itself (usually using self), which allows the next method in the chain to          be called on the same object.\n",
    "      How it works:\n",
    "        For method chaining to work, each method must return self (the instance of the object) after performing its task. \n",
    "        This way, the object is returned, and you can immediately call another method on it."

    "Q25] What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
    "Ans :__call__ -: \n",
    "        The __call__ method in Python is a special or \"dunder\" method (short for \"double underscore\") that allows an instance of a class to be called           like a function. When an object is invoked (called) directly as if it were a function, Python will internally call the __call__ method.\n",
    "        Purpose of __call__:\n",
    "            Making an Object Callable: The main purpose of the __call__ method is to enable instances of a class to behave like functions.\n",
    "            This can be useful in scenarios where you want to encapsulate callable behavior in an object, allowing you to combine object-oriented                   features with function-like behavior.\n",
    "        Flexibility: It allows instances to have flexible behavior, where different calls to the object can trigger different logic or processes.\n",
    "     How It Works:\n",
    "        When you create an instance of a class and then \"call\" the instance (i.e., obj()), Python will invoke the __call__ method of the instance.\n",
    "        The __call__ method can accept parameters, allowing you to pass arguments when calling the object."
